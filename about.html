                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Jimme van Duijnhoven, and I'm 20 years old. I'm currently a first-year HBO student studying game design at Saxion University in Enschede.
                </br><br/>     
                My biggest passions are gaming and creating games, which is why I chose this course of study.
                </br><br/>              
                I'm focused on developing into a professional game designer. I have a background in coding using Unity with C# and Unreal Engine with Blueprints.
                </br><br/>                 
                Additionally, I'm learning how to create 3D models for my games to better visualize my ideas. In my spare time, I enjoy developing games just for fun.
