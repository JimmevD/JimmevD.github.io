                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m Jimme van Duijnhoven, a passionate game design student currently studying at Saxion University in Enschede. I have a strong interest in gaming, designing, and creating games, which is why I chose this career path.
                </br><br/>     
                I have over five years of experience working with Unity and C#, and I’m skilled in using Unreal Engine with Blueprints. I love designing games, especially system design and level design. I enjoy collaborating with others and 
                have experience working in teams to achieve common goals, share ideas, and ensure smooth communication throughout development projects. My goal is to become a professional game designer who creates engaging, visually appealing, 
                and, most of all, enjoyable experiences.
                </br><br/>              
                In my free time, I love working on personal game projects and exploring new tools and techniques to improve both my technical and design skills.
                </p>
