                    <h2>About the Project</h2>
                    <h3>Concept</h3>
                    <p>Candice Wickle is a puzzle platformer, where you need to complete 3 levels to escape the cave. Candice can control the water levels 
                        to move boxes and solve puzzles. Due to a curse Candice can't touch the water herself or she will die. 
                        <br></br>
                        This game was made in a team of 6 people and completed in 6 days.

                    <h2>Progress</h2>
                    <p>For this project, I was the lead level designer. After co-designing the mechanics with the other designer, we decided to create three levels. Each level introduces a different mechanic, starting with Level 1, which covers all the basic controls.</p>                     
            
                    <div class="progress-item">
                        <img src="../Images/Candice-Wickle/ProgressPictures/Level1Grid.png" alt="Level 1 sketch grid" class="progress-image">
                        <div class="progress-text">
                            <h3 class="progress-heading">Workflow</h3>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">For the sketches, I had to work with a grid since the engine's collision system could only handle blocks. I created a simple grid so all the blocks would align correctly. I did this in Photoshop and also tested the levels there by moving components around based on what the tester wanted to do. After the base mechanics were coded, testing moved into the engine, allowing us to tweak player movement at the same time.</p>

                    </div>
            
                    <div class="progress-item reverse">

                            <h3 class="progress-heading">Level 1 sketch</h3>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">In the first level, I wanted to create a simple puzzle to introduce the mechanics. This included movement, boxes, buttons, walls, fans, and water level control. Initially, the level was too complex, but after a bit of playtesting, I adjusted it to be just right for a first level.</p>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">While figuring out how to explain the mechanics, I decided against creating a separate tutorial level. Instead, we added engravings on the walls to explain the mechanics in a more natural way.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
            
                    <div class="progress-item">
                        <img src="../Images/Candice-Wickle/ProgressPictures/Level2.png" alt="Level 2 sketch" class="progress-image">
                        <div class="progress-text">
                            <h3 class="progress-heading">Level 2 sketch</h3>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">This level introduces the turtle mechanic. Turtles remain still when they are not in water, but when they are on the water’s surface, they move left and right. Turtles can also trigger buttons. Since turtles have multiple functions, introducing the mechanic clearly was a challenge. I started with a turtle resting on a button, showing that it remains still when not in water. To help players understand that turtles move on water, I slightly raised the water level at the start of the level, so the turtle at the bottom started swimming. Turtles could also carry boxes, to show this to the player I made sure the second turtle in the level started with a box on its head.</p>
                        </br>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">During testing, players found this level harder than the original Level 3. Because of this, I swapped the two levels, improving the overall player experience.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
            
                    <div class="progress-item reverse">
                        <img src="../Images/Candice-Wickle/ProgressPictures/Level3.png" alt="Level 3 sketch" class="progress-image">
                        <div class="progress-text">
                            <h3 class="progress-heading">Level 3 sketch</h3>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">This level introduces a new mechanic: bubbles. When standing in a bubble, the player doesn’t die when touched by water. With this in mind, I placed bubbles in key spots where the water needed to rise higher than normal, but I made sure it wasn’t too obvious. This mechanic opened up a lot of new possibilities.</p>
                        </br>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">Just like the original Level 2, this level was swapped. Since players found it easier than the turtle level, it made more sense to switch them.</p>
