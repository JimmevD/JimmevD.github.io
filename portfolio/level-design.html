                    <h2>Progress</h2>
                    <p>Here is a look into the development progress of my project. I documented key steps including initial sketches, block-outs, and final set dressing.</p>
                    <p>I researched how other games, like Portal 2, structured their levels. I found that their design process often involved sketching and refining ideas before jumping into the block-out stage. This approach inspired my puzzle-based design where I introduced mechanics gradually, ensuring the puzzles were fun, challenging, and smooth in progression.</p>
                    <p>I used the <strong>Ultimate FPS Puzzle Kit</strong> for Unreal Engine to create the structure and mechanics of my levels. I focused on ensuring a gradual learning curve, using the mechanics to introduce new challenges as the player progresses through the levels.</p>
                     

                    <div class="progress-item">
                        <img src="../Images/level-design/ProgressPictures/Level1.png" alt="Level 1 sketch" class="progress-image">

                            <h3 class="progress-heading">Level 1 sketch</h3>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">The sketch for Level 1 focused on designing a layout that introduced the core mechanics in a simple, digestible way. I aimed for a clean and minimalistic design where players could easily understand the mechanics through visual cues. The sketch included areas where players would first encounter cubes, buttons, and stairs in a straightforward manner.</p>
                        </br>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">The initial sketches involved a few basic rooms: Room 1 introduced cube spawning, Room 2 involved carrying cubes, Room 3 challenged players to throw cubes over glass walls, and Room 4 brought together all the mechanics into one larger puzzle, ensuring players could build on their knowledge as they progressed.</p>

                    </div>
            
                    <div class="progress-item reverse">

                            <h3 class="progress-heading">Level 1 block-out</h3>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">For the block-out of Level 1, I started translating the sketches into a 3D space, using basic shapes and geometry to define the level’s layout. This stage allowed me to see how the puzzles felt in a real environment, ensuring the flow of the level made sense and was achievable.</p>
                        </br>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">The block-out was designed to confirm that the player could solve each puzzle with ease while still being challenged. I focused on the placement of the cubes, buttons, and stairs to ensure they worked as intended and tested for any potential issues in puzzle progression and level flow.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                            <h3 class="progress-heading">Level 2 sketch</h3>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">For Level 2, I wanted to introduce more complexity. The sketch included additional mechanics like lasers and reflecting cubes. I envisioned rooms that required players to solve puzzles using these new mechanics while still incorporating the basic cube and button interactions from Level 1.</p>
                        </br>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">The design process for Level 2 involved adding different layers of complexity. In the sketches, the puzzles began to focus on the interaction between lasers, cubes, and other environmental elements, gradually increasing the challenge and ensuring that each room had a distinct theme and puzzle mechanic.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                            <h3 class="progress-heading">Level 2 block-out</h3>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">During the block-out phase for Level 2, I translated the ideas from the sketches into 3D space. This included placing lasers, reflecting cubes, and adjusting the geometry to make sure that the challenges felt intuitive and the puzzles worked seamlessly with the new mechanics.</p>
                        </br>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">I paid close attention to how the lasers interacted with other elements, ensuring that the reflecting cubes could direct the beams appropriately. I also tested how players could solve each puzzle, making adjustments to the layout as needed to ensure a smooth difficulty curve and puzzle progression.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                            <h3 class="progress-heading">Level 3 sketch</h3>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">For the hardest level, Level 3, I wanted to include even more complex mechanics such as moving platforms, sliders, and time manipulation. The sketch focused on combining these mechanics in interesting ways, with rooms that required players to think critically about timing, placement, and movement.</p>
                        </br>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">I started by designing rooms that combined these mechanics in a way that felt challenging but fair. Moving platforms and sliders were used to create puzzles that required careful timing and puzzle-solving, while the time-slowing mechanic added a new layer of complexity to the puzzles.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p class="progress-paragraph">When I moved on to the block-out for Level 3, I focused on implementing these new mechanics in the 3D space. The goal was to make sure the time-slowing mechanic, moving platforms, and sliders all worked together and that the player could use these mechanics to solve the puzzles as intended.</p>
                        </br>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">I carefully designed the layout to ensure the moving platforms and sliders worked in sync with the player’s actions, and I made sure the time-slowing mechanic was incorporated in a way that didn’t feel out of place. This stage was essential for fine-tuning the difficulty and puzzle flow before moving on to assets and set dressing.</p>

                            <p class="progress-paragraph">As the block-outs were complete, I focused on the set dressing phase. I added various assets to give the levels personality and make them visually cohesive with the mechanics. My goal was to ensure that the puzzles felt like they belonged in the environments and that the visuals enhanced the puzzle-solving experience.</p>
                        </br>
                            <p class="progress-paragraph">This phase involved adding textures, adjusting lighting, and ensuring that the environment supported the gameplay. The set dressing played a critical role in enhancing the player’s immersion and making sure the visuals were in sync with the mechanics of the game.</p>
