        <h2>Progress</h2>
        <p>For this project, I wanted to make a custom Quake level using TrenchBroom. I began by analyzing existing Quake levels to understand how they were designed, then created sketches which I translated into TrenchBroom. Through multiple iterations and playtesting, I refined the level and implemented feedback to make it feel more like a classic Quake experience. Below is a summary of my process:</p>
        
        <div class="progress-item">

            <div class="progress-text">
                <h3 class="progress-heading">Analysing</h3>
                <p class="progress-paragraph">I started by analyzing the first three levels of Quake (E1M1, E1M2, and E1M3). During this process, I studied pacing, enemy placement, looping paths, and how resources such as ammo and health packs were distributed. I also noted how Quake guides players with light, sound, and sightlines. This analysis helped me understand how to create a level that fits the style of Quake.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="progress-text">
                <h3 class="progress-heading">Testing Trenchbroom</h3>
                <p class="progress-paragraph">After the analysis, I experimented with TrenchBroom by creating a small test map. This helped me understand the basics of the editor, such as building geometry, texturing, and exporting maps into Quake. I followed tutorials to set up the tools properly and used this stage to familiarize myself with the workflow before starting my own level.</p>

        </div>

            <div class="progress-text">
                <h3 class="progress-heading">Designing the level</h3>
                <p class="progress-paragraph">Once I felt comfortable with TrenchBroom, I started designing my own level. I sketched it out top-down to plan the layout and flow. I focused on making multiple routes, areas for combat, and secret spots to discover. These sketches served as a blueprint for building the 3D version of the level.</p>

                <h3 class="progress-heading">Making the level</h3>
                <p class="progress-paragraph">I then translated the sketches into TrenchBroom by blocking out the geometry and adding textures. At this stage, I placed enemies, weapons, and resources while testing how players could move through the environment. This phase was all about making the level functional and playable, even if the visuals weren’t final yet.</p>
                <p>However, while making the level, some of the things I designed didn’t work out well in the editor. This led to some big changes in certain areas.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="progress-item">
            <img src="../Images/quake-level/ProgressPictures/Big Changes.png" alt="Big Changes in the level" class="progress-image">
            <div class="progress-text">
                <h3 class="progress-heading">Big Changes</h3>
                <p class="progress-paragraph"><strong>Change 1:</strong> I reworked the very first area of the map to make it less empty. I added a pillar with an arch and a wall extension on the left, giving the player more cover and naturally guiding them toward the door first.</p>
                </br>
                <p class="progress-paragraph"><strong>Change 2:</strong> The first big sewer fight was updated with more objects to fill the space and make it less empty. I redesigned the first secret so it’s harder to spot. Hiding the entrance in a hole in the wall turned out to be much more visible underwater than I initially thought. It’s now located in the corner of a stone. I also added walls under the main platform so the secret isn’t visible right away. The enemies here were changed from ogres to zombies (since ogres kept falling off), and I reduced the number of fish to avoid clutter.</p>
                </br>
                <p class="progress-paragraph"><strong>Change 3:</strong> I switched the order of the sewer area and the final fight to improve pacing. This way, players get a calmer section before the last big encounter. The level now ends with a boss fight, which fits Quake’s style, followed by a small exploration area where the player escapes to the surface. This change also ties into the story and gives players some rest before finishing the level.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="progress-item reverse">

            <div class="progress-text">
                <h3 class="progress-heading">Testing iteration 1</h3>
                <p class="progress-paragraph">After finishing the first playable version, I let testers try the level. Their feedback was very valuable as they pointed out some good issues. One of my favorite parts of the feedback was rethinking if the key or door should be found first. After some research, I realized that for what I intended, the player should find the door first to give them a purpose to look for the key. Here is the most important feedback from this test:</p>
                </br>    
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce the number of health and ammo packs</li>
                    <li>Make better ramps/platforms for climbing out of water</li>
                    <li>Add more triggers for enemies so they appear correctly</li>
                    <li>Make entrances bigger in the boss room to avoid players getting stuck</li>
                    <li>Reduce the amount of light in the level</li>
                    <li>Add sounds to doors opening</li>
                    <li>Fix the boss bug that unlocks all secrets after being killed</li>
                    <li>Consider swapping the order of areas to improve player flow</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="progress-item">
            <img src="../Images/quake-level/ProgressPictures/Iteration2.png" alt="Testing iteration 2" class="progress-image">
            <div class="progress-text">
                <h3 class="progress-heading">Testing iteration 2</h3>
                <p class="progress-paragraph">After the second test, it was clear that my changes made the map better, but I still had some problems. The biggest issue was that the map didn’t use enough height variety and multiple routes, so it didn’t feel like a classic Quake map. I had been procrastinating on this change because I knew it would cost a lot of time. With the current feedback, I definitely needed to do it in order to make the level complete. In hindsight, I’m happy I did this as it made the level way better. Here was the most important feedback from this round:</p>
                </br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add delays to doors in the second boss wave so enemies don’t all spawn at once</li>
                    <li>Remove zombies from the boss fight to prevent soft locking</li>
                    <li>Replace the rocket launcher with a grenade launcher, since rockets cause too many accidental deaths in small rooms</li>
                    <li>Make the boss drop from the roof to prevent camping behind the central pillar</li>
                    <li>Add more paths, especially in the sewer section</li>
                    <li>Add more height variety where possible</li>
                    <li>Include a bit more decoration here and there</li>
                    <li>Widen the bridge on the water platform so players don’t accidentally fall into the secret</li>
                    <li>Increase the size of the final arch when swimming up so players don’t get stuck</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="progress-item reverse">
            <img src="../Images/quake-level/ProgressPictures/Iteration3.png" alt="Final Result" class="progress-image">
            <div class="progress-text">
                <h3 class="progress-heading">Final Result</h3>
                <p class="progress-paragraph">In the final iteration, I polished the visuals with improved lighting, textures, and set dressing. I also refined the boss fight with a wave system and adjusted enemy spawns for better balance. The final level includes multiple paths, height variety, secrets, and varied combat spaces, resulting in a complete Quake experience. I did a small run after these changes to see what the tester thought and they were all really impressed with how good the changes made the level. I am really happy with how the level turned out, so feel free to try it out yourself!</p>
